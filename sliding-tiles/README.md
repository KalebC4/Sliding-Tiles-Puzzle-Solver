# 3620 Final Project: Sliding Tiles

This project is a collaboration effort from a group of 4:
Ebubechukwu Agada,
Kaleb Calverley,
Divya Pateliya, and
Ishwor Tandon.

The goal of this project is to create a solver for a Sliding Tiles puzzle (also called an 8-puzzle) by implementing an A* search algorithm that utilizes a Manhattan Distance heuristic. 

Input the current state and desired state of the puzzle layout via command line, and the solver returns a series of moves to make that is close to the fastest or fastest solution to solve the puzzle.
